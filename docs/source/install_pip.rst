pip workflow
===================
easyPheno can be installed via ``pip`` and used as a common Python library:

    .. code-block::

        pip install easypheno

Our setup is finished! Go to :ref:`HowTo: Use easyPheno as a pip package` to see how you can now use easyPheno!

The pipeline was developed and tested with `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3813/>`_ and `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.
The framework should work with Windows and Mac as well, but we do not officially provide support for these platform.
We neither officially support other Python versions, however easyPheno should run as well for versions >= 3.8. If these requirements are not fulfilled, we recommend the :ref:`Docker workflow`.
