pip Workflow
===================
easyPheno can be installed via ``pip`` and used as a common Python library.


The pipeline was developed and tested with `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3813/>`_ and `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.
The framework should work with Windows and Mac as well, but we do not officially provide support for these platform.
We neither officially support other Python versions, however easyPheno might run as well. If these requirements are not fulfilled, we recommend the :ref:`Docker Workflow`.


Just install easyPheno via ``pip``:

    .. code-block::

        pip install PACKAGENAME

Our setup is finished! Go to :ref:`HowTo: Run easyPheno as a pip package` to see how you can now use easyPheno!
